# 100_days_of_code_python
These are the exercises and projects I completed on my own without a solution, unless noted, while participating in the 100daysofpython.dev course. Below you will find instructions I needed to follow to accomplish each task, my thoughts, and things I learned. 

## Day 1

## Day 4
Today was all about lists and using random. I let too much time lapse between when I first started this day and when I finished. However, this was a good way for me to use my Google skils and review my other code to find the answers I needed. 

#### [4-1-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-1-exercise.py)
You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This challange was pretty easy. It built right off the previous day by using if, else statements. 

#### [4-2-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-2-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name


###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I really liked this challenge. This one made me really stop and think about what we were trying to achieve with the final outcome. I was able to incorporate things I learned previously and use the new knowledge from today. It also made me think about the way computers count items starting with 0.
