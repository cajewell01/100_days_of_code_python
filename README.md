# 100_days_of_code_python
These are the exercises and projects I completed on my own without a solution, unless noted, while participating in the 100daysofpython.dev course. Below you will find instructions I needed to follow to accomplish each task, my thoughts, and things I learned. 

## Day 1
This was just a basic intro. We covered printing, inputs, and concatenation. There were no exercies just the project. 

#### [Project: Band Name Generator](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-1-project-band-name-generator.py)
Using the city you grew up in and the name of a pet, create a program that will print the name of your new band. 

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I have coded a little before so this felt familiar and I'm now excited to get started!

## Day 2
Today was data types and f-strings

#### [2-1-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-2-1-exercise.py)
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was a great dive into types and I made myself some notes in my code. 

#### [2-2-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-2-2-exercise.py)
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was a basic exercise that really focused on using types and math. It was a good check to see if I remembered to make sure I had made strings into ints. 

#### [2-3-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-2-3-exercise.py)
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
Again it was great practice on changing strings to ints and also using f-strings. Although I'm not sure how excited I was to find out how many days, weeks, and months I had left until I am 90.....

#### [Project: Tip Calculator](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-2-project-tip-calculator.py)
If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
Just a great continuation of the exercises that were completed prior to the project. This did require a little bit of googling, but that was fun and something I know I will do frequently while coding. 

## Day 3
Today was all about IF statements and Logical Operators. I got carried away on this day, in a good way. 

#### [3-1-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-3-1-exercise.py)
Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was a basic exercise and pretty much was a repeat of something that we did in the lesson.

#### [3-2-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-3-2-exercise.py)
Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Above 35 they are clinically obese.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
Again this was further practice on IF statements but it was also pratice on f-strings which I thought was neat. 

#### [3-3-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-3-3-exercise.py)
Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 

We were also given this [flowchart](https://app.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Leap%20Algorithm#R7VpNc9owEP01HNuxJdmYY4CkzTTNdEpmmhyFrdhqhcXIIkB%2BfSUsY4wcQhqwC%2B0p0urDu29Xu08KHTiYLD4JPE2%2B8oiwDnCiRQcOOwC4CPjqj5Ysc0k3gLkgFjQyk0rBiD4TI3SMdEYjklUmSs6ZpNOqMORpSkJZkWEh%2BLw67ZGz6lenOCaWYBRiZkt/0EgmuTQA3VL%2BmdA4Kb7s%2Br18ZIKLycaSLMERn2%2BI4GUHDgTnMm9NFgPCNHgFLvm6qxdG14oJksp9FoDbYTJlQFxPomj0Jbzr4tT9YJTN5LIwmETKftPlQiY85ilml6W0L/gsjYje1VG9cs4N51MldJXwJ5FyaZyJZ5IrUSInzIwqhcXyXq//6BXdB7PdqjNcVHpL08t11Qq%2BCIERZXwmQrLD7iKUsIiJ3DEPrB2lIpzwCVH6qHWCMCzpU1UPbEItXs8rvaEaxiFvcI7Z9wmzmfnS6O7i%2B53lstIhGt15QiUZTfHK/rk6lVXwzZ5ESLLYDaNttlkAYE85brVoWZxWE%2BTz8oy4xRFONs4Hco6ElfePBjLYM5DhOwN5tfRCCLzcmDDlNJXZxs7ftKAMFLcLtgKlyOulq/M9S8evlfvzWPD/x8LOWHCdQwSD5W3kdre97W8d91w1s64Mg7fGFQLWl5qIK2Dl4%2BtMr9GahYzglGkjOsBnCv3%2BWKhWrFsRfaIZHas4A85YT0EdeGVn8YRPxrOsmQxe8Jcif3dr8jf07PwdHCt/QwvbW65xvSHK/HcVvEfK2IAzLlZr4WMQkjBU8kwK/otsjIwDD3nOYQB23SrA65PQWoHs1gBsAasMllX0MKNxqtqhMpwooPoaFqr48YUZmNAoyjMoyegzHq%2B20iiaQ6z29fodb6j3Ukkzy/PngeLYDSwm0rOBhjU4g2PhHFg4P5Ds5IGG/j5AoyaBdmErZX5B5X1RyFX7oaz4qlfWeN0pSvxfQA2KVPM6N2j3xhO06VP3XH2KWvWpcyjapG%2BZLRMn6IPX63pdvTkacXJtVnpwzhR5JIhQHWcKwBj6/oFIqVfFFtaR0kY5E2jnVeFESwzaMx2BVtMRaOd14ERLzL4%2BdXutlhh0qBKD2i8xyNum2rWJsI5rH6/I9M6lyHi9bXRRzUWm4TJjM6RzuDOi3hZXClq%2BMRYmnNcbCHS3I7oO6EbfQIDNSc8AaGQBDdt%2BbAL2s%2Bk5ZA47Sdch3WzusCnGST9QQ9RkHVTd8ocO%2Bb9jyp%2BLwMvf) to help us with figuring out what years would be leap years. 

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I liked getting into nesting IF statements and making sure that they all lined up. At first I didn't have the [flowchart](https://app.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Leap%20Algorithm#R7VpNc9owEP01HNuxJdmYY4CkzTTNdEpmmhyFrdhqhcXIIkB%2BfSUsY4wcQhqwC%2B0p0urDu29Xu08KHTiYLD4JPE2%2B8oiwDnCiRQcOOwC4CPjqj5Ysc0k3gLkgFjQyk0rBiD4TI3SMdEYjklUmSs6ZpNOqMORpSkJZkWEh%2BLw67ZGz6lenOCaWYBRiZkt/0EgmuTQA3VL%2BmdA4Kb7s%2Br18ZIKLycaSLMERn2%2BI4GUHDgTnMm9NFgPCNHgFLvm6qxdG14oJksp9FoDbYTJlQFxPomj0Jbzr4tT9YJTN5LIwmETKftPlQiY85ilml6W0L/gsjYje1VG9cs4N51MldJXwJ5FyaZyJZ5IrUSInzIwqhcXyXq//6BXdB7PdqjNcVHpL08t11Qq%2BCIERZXwmQrLD7iKUsIiJ3DEPrB2lIpzwCVH6qHWCMCzpU1UPbEItXs8rvaEaxiFvcI7Z9wmzmfnS6O7i%2B53lstIhGt15QiUZTfHK/rk6lVXwzZ5ESLLYDaNttlkAYE85brVoWZxWE%2BTz8oy4xRFONs4Hco6ElfePBjLYM5DhOwN5tfRCCLzcmDDlNJXZxs7ftKAMFLcLtgKlyOulq/M9S8evlfvzWPD/x8LOWHCdQwSD5W3kdre97W8d91w1s64Mg7fGFQLWl5qIK2Dl4%2BtMr9GahYzglGkjOsBnCv3%2BWKhWrFsRfaIZHas4A85YT0EdeGVn8YRPxrOsmQxe8Jcif3dr8jf07PwdHCt/QwvbW65xvSHK/HcVvEfK2IAzLlZr4WMQkjBU8kwK/otsjIwDD3nOYQB23SrA65PQWoHs1gBsAasMllX0MKNxqtqhMpwooPoaFqr48YUZmNAoyjMoyegzHq%2B20iiaQ6z29fodb6j3Ukkzy/PngeLYDSwm0rOBhjU4g2PhHFg4P5Ds5IGG/j5AoyaBdmErZX5B5X1RyFX7oaz4qlfWeN0pSvxfQA2KVPM6N2j3xhO06VP3XH2KWvWpcyjapG%2BZLRMn6IPX63pdvTkacXJtVnpwzhR5JIhQHWcKwBj6/oFIqVfFFtaR0kY5E2jnVeFESwzaMx2BVtMRaOd14ERLzL4%2BdXutlhh0qBKD2i8xyNum2rWJsI5rH6/I9M6lyHi9bXRRzUWm4TJjM6RzuDOi3hZXClq%2BMRYmnNcbCHS3I7oO6EbfQIDNSc8AaGQBDdt%2BbAL2s%2Bk5ZA47Sdch3WzusCnGST9QQ9RkHVTd8ocO%2Bb9jyp%2BLwMvf) so I had to troubleshoot my code because it was off, but I was able to get it fixed with the visual. 

#### [3-4-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-3-4-exercise.py)
Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

Small Pizza: $15
Small Pizza: $15
Medium Pizza: $20
Medium Pizza: $20
Large Pizza: $25
Large Pizza: $25
Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was the first practice with elif. My code was not as straightforward as the instructors, but I am learning every day and will continue on making my code cleaner and more direct. 

#### [3-5-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-3-5-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

To work out the love score between two people:

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
"Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
"Your score is **z**."

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was the first project that I really struggled on. It was the first time I needed to use If statements that had <, >. I also know that my code was not as clean as it could be but I was proud for what I had accomplished. 

#### [Project: Text Game Treasure Island](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-3-project-text-game-treasure-island.py)
Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as if, else, and elif statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I lost myself in making my game. I made it so large that I needed to make an [excel sheet](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-3-project-treasure-island-game-test-scenarios.xlsx) so I could test all the possible scenarios and mark whether or not they worked out. It was so much fun! I'm hoping that I learn a better way to clean up my code here, but if not I REALLY got some practice with nested if statements and testing my code to make sure that it all worked out.  

## Day 4
Today was all about lists and using random. I let too much time lapse between when I first started this day and when I finished. However, this was a good way for me to use my Google skils and review my other code to find the answers I needed. 

#### [4-1-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-1-exercise.py)
You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This challange was pretty easy. It built right off the previous day by using if, else statements. 

#### [4-2-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-2-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I really liked this challenge. This one made me really stop and think about what we were trying to achieve with the final outcome. I was able to incorporate things I learned previously and use the new knowledge from today. It also made me think about the way computers count items starting with 0. 

#### [4-3-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-3-exercise.py)
Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number. e.g.:

First your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.

Next, you need to use it to update your nested list with an "x".

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
Again I really liked the logic of figuring out the code. Once you moved past thinking of the logic the code wa very straightforward. I did add a note in my code so as I am learning I can go back to it and remember the logic behind what I did. 


#### [Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-project-rock-paper-scissors.py)
Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

Inside the main.py file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: rock, paper, and scissors. This will make it easy to print them out to the console.

Start the game by asking the player:

"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."

From there you will need to figure out:

How you will store the user's input.
How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
And also how you will give feedback to the player.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I think this tied up the lessons of the day very well. After the previous two exercises this felt straightforward. Although, I did originally miss if, elif statements for there being a draw. But I figured it out quickly at the end when playing with the game provided by the instructor. 

## Day 5
Today was about For Loops and Ranges. 

#### [5-1-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-1-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This challange was hard for me. I thought I understood For Loops in the lecture video but realized I needed more help. I figured out as much as I could on my own, but then needed help. I like to do it on my own, but will use the instructor video if needed on an exercise. However, I always try to be very honest when I did it on my own or with help.  

#### [5-2-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-2-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
After the help I recieved on the first exercise this one came a bit easier. Because there was a lapse in my learning I had forgot about if statements and that made this exercise take longer than it should have. After reviewing the previous days I realized that an if statement would work well here and it helped me solve the exercise. 

#### [5-3-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-3-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was the first project that used Range and I enjoyed tying together range and for loops. After the previous two challenges this one felt easier. 


#### [5-4-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-4-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I struggled with this one, but only because of the math portion of the game. The logic of the if statements and the order needed was easy (I like if statements), but the math functions got me. I need to do a deeper dive into the math functions again. I knew what I wanted to happen, but it took awhile to get there with the math. 


#### [Project: Password Generator](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-project-password-generator.py)
There were no written instructions for this project, but the gist was to take what we had learned from the day and build off the provided code to make a password generator. 

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This project took a LOT of Googleing because I had never used join or shuffle before. The earlier exercises really helped prepare me for this final project. I will say that I want to look more into .join and learn more about it and how it works behind the scenes. 

## Day 6
Today was about While Loops, Functions, and Indentations. The entire day was spent at [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle1.json) using the Hurdle and Maze exercises. 

#### [6-1-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-6-1-exercise.PNG)

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was the first exercise of defining functions and I loved learning about this feature. I can see where this will be super helpful down the line. Through a little bit of trial and error this challenge wasn't really bad. It did take me a moment on the for loop to think about the number of steps, but overall I would say this challenge was more on the easy/medium side. 

#### [6-2-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-6-2-exercise.png) 

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was the first use of the while loop and the program needed to run until it got to flag and then stopped. I found this task actually easier than the previous because I just needed to tell the program to keep running until false. 

#### [6-3-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-6-3-exercise.png)

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I struggled with this one at first, but that was because I did not know that the use of not was something I could choose to do. Once I figured out using not coding the if/elif statement was easy. I do like that I can use not when making a loop because sometimes that logic is far more helpful than only making a positive statement. 

#### [6-4-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-6-4-exercise.png)

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I knew what I wanted the program to do, but I didn't know how to get there. I needed the help to know that I needed to add some while loops to the hurdle function. Although, I kept with it I really struggled with figuring out the logic here.  

#### [Project: Reeborg's World Maze](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-project.png)

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
Again, this was something that was hard for me. I'm not sure where I need to turn, but I really think I need to get more practice with logic problems like this. I understand what the code does, I can vizualize what I want to happen, but there is a disconnect for me in turning it into code. This is something I need to improve on because I would like to do this will no help in the future.
