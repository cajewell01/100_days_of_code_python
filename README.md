# 100_days_of_code_python
These are the exercises and projects I completed on my own without a solution, unless noted, while participating in the 100daysofpython.dev course. Below you will find instructions I needed to follow to accomplish each task, my thoughts, and things I learned. 

## Day 1

## Day 4
Today was all about lists and using random. I let too much time lapse between when I first started this day and when I finished. However, this was a good way for me to use my Google skils and review my other code to find the answers I needed. 

#### [4-1-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-1-exercise.py)
You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This challange was pretty easy. It built right off the previous day by using if, else statements. 

#### [4-2-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-2-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I really liked this challenge. This one made me really stop and think about what we were trying to achieve with the final outcome. I was able to incorporate things I learned previously and use the new knowledge from today. It also made me think about the way computers count items starting with 0. 

#### [4-3-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-3-exercise.py)
Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number. e.g.:

First your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.

Next, you need to use it to update your nested list with an "x".

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
Again I really liked the logic of figuring out the code. Once you moved past thinking of the logic the code wa very straightforward. I did add a note in my code so as I am learning I can go back to it and remember the logic behind what I did. 


#### [Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-4-project-rock-paper-scissors.py)
Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

Inside the main.py file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: rock, paper, and scissors. This will make it easy to print them out to the console.

Start the game by asking the player:

"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."

From there you will need to figure out:

How you will store the user's input.
How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
And also how you will give feedback to the player.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I think this tied up the lessons of the day very well. After the previous two exercises this felt straightforward. Although, I did originally miss if, elif statements for there being a draw. But I figured it out quickly at the end when playing with the game provided by the instructor.
