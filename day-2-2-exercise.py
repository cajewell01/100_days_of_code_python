#Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

bmi = int(weight)/float(height)**2
whole_bmi = int(bmi)
print(whole_bmi)


#Make sure that you are paying attention to the math and thinking logically when making the program.
